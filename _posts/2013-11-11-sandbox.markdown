You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Post absolute url:
{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2013-11-11-sandbox %}

Including lightboxed images:
{% capture assets %}/images/test{% endcapture %}
{% include img t='Title 1a' f='1.jpg' ff='2.jpg' g='x' w=1024 %}
