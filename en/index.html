<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a programmer during the day and a tinkerer in the evening. Currently I develop iOS apps for living.
    I've also done several bigger projects in Java and PHP.</p>

<p>I am interested in Bitcoins, CNC machines, 3D printing, microcontrollers and electronics in general.
    My biggest hobby project so far is hackerspace <a href="https://thecave.cz" target="_blank">The Cave</a>.</p>
