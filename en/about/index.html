<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>I am a programmer during the day and a tinkerer in the evening - fascinated by the world of computers and engineering.
    I used to build moving and blinking things from Lego or create simple programs on my 8-bit computer since I was a kid.
    Thanks to my interest in computer games I learned how to create programs for PC. Together with my friends
    we tried to make games and our efforts were successful (at least in our opinion) - our game <a href="http://www.hrej.cz/plne-hry-zdarma/akce/arkada/tanky-ii-jvp/" target="_blank">Tanky 2</a>
    was bundled on the CD of Score - Czech magazine for gamers.</p>

<p>When Java enabled mobile phones got common I started learning how to make <abbr title="Java Micro Edition">J2ME</abbr> apps.
    After creating a few games I entered a Czech competition for young indie game developers called Becherovka Game.
    I won second place with RPG <a href="http://game.becher.cz/?page=game&amp;id=246" target="_blank">Prokletí Becherova</a>.</p>

<p>In the year 2006 I began my studies at Czech Technical University in Prague. As part of the courses at the university I
    created various electronic devices and one of them became the topic of my
    <a href="https://dip.felk.cvut.cz/browse/details.php?f=F3&amp;d=K13136&amp;y=2009&amp;a=dolezjin&amp;t=bach" target="_blank">bachelor thesis</a>.
    During the studies I also worked as a freelancer. I made a few mobile games and also mobile and desktop app for
    streaming video from IP cameras.
</p>

<p>Later I designed and implemented CRM for an outbound call centre. Originally it was planned as a smaller
    project but in the end it kept me and ten other programmers busy for about two years.</p>

<p>After that I looked into PHP and <a href="http://nette.org" target="_blank">Nette framework</a> - which soon became
    my favorite tool for creating websites. The most interesting project which I helped to create in this area
    is Slytab.com - a tool for easy creation of Facebook pages.</p>

<p>When Apple released SDK for the iPhone, I started learning how to develop apps for iOS. It was just a hobby at first
    but then it became my main source of income. I worked mainly on Czech news and magazine apps - for example
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/lidove-noviny/id430847422?mt=8" target="_blank">Lidové Noviny</a>,
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/mf-dnes/id484913802?mt=8" target="_blank">MF DNES</a>,
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/hospodarske-noviny/id471315011?mt=8" target="_blank">Hospodářské Noviny</a>
    and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/tydenik-echo/id886689760?mt=8" target="_blank">Týdeník Echo</a>.

    You can also find one of my &quot;hobby&quot; apps on the AppStore -
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/infotabule/id515329309?mt=8" target="_blank">InfoTabule</a> which helps
    you to get around on Czech railways.</p>

<p>In 2016 me and my friends rented a place in Prague and rebuilt it into <a href="https://thecave.cz" target="_blank">The Cave</a> hackerspace.</p>
